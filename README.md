NEBULA was made as a script testing community, now it has become part of NebulaHub and nUNC.

Owner's history:
NEBULA, or known as "Soulin / SoulX / Backdoor", created their first ever script called xUNC, now xUNC was a UNC test that used the NamingStandard API for its function test, it has a fully Custom API. It was great until NEBULA lost the xUNC file and had to rebrand to dmUNC, NEBULA lost that too, so NEBULA quit making UNC tests and scripts for a while. Until he had an idea to make a executor called "Soulin" which was level 4, it used Xeno (the executor)'s Custom API for its execution and attachment, and it was really good. After that, Soulin got shut down since NEBULA's Visual Studio broke and could no longer work on it. NEBULA Stopped working on executor's and stuff for a while, until NEBULA started making scripts on ScriptBlox and intoducing a Universal ScriptHub that got over 20k Views, NEBULA was now popular, NEBULA started posting more scripts for more games, then he stopped.. Now NEBULA is back and working on more stuff including "NebulaHub" and "nUNC" which are currently active right now at https://discord.gg/Qg756YWDMZ.
